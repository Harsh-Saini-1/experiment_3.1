# Product Card Component 📦

This project demonstrates how to build a reusable **React component** that displays dynamic data using **props**. The goal is to show how to pass different product information to a single component and have it render correctly without any changes to its code.

## 🚀 Objective
The objective is to understand and apply the concept of **props** in React to create a flexible and reusable UI component.

## 🌟 Features
* **Reusable Component:** The `ProductCard` is a single component that can be used to display any product.
* **Dynamic Data:** Product details (name, price, status) are passed to the component via props.
* **Dynamic Rendering:** The UI updates dynamically based on the data provided, demonstrating core React principles.
